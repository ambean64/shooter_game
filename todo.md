# TODO

## Specific Enough
+ Find a better way to implement a user selection menu than using a temporary variable.
+ Improve "struct character" in "include/structs.h" to use malloc() for array size (instead of a fixed size).
+ Figure out a way to cleanly include the text of said story into the game (besides hard-coding it).

## Pretty Vague
+ Develop a combat system.
+ Create a story.
